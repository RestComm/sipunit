For license information: Open the file

For the SipUnit API class javadocs: open the file 
	docs/api/index.html using a web browser.
	
For tutorial-type examples, see
	http://www.cafesip.org/projects/sipunit/user_guide.html#An_Example_Test_Class
	http://www.cafesip.org/projects/sipunit/user_guide.html#An_Example_of_Using_the_JAIN-SIP_API_
	
For actual example test classes using SipUnit, see the java files in the
	examples/org/cafesip/sipunit/test directory. You can run the TestNoProxy
	test right away as long as sipunit/examples and the jar files from 
	sipunit/lib are in the classpath (more on running the test classes below). 
	For running some of the other test classes, a proxy is required. For setup info,
	see the header comments about proxy setup in each test java file and also visit 
	http://www.cafesip.org/projects/sipunit/user_guide.html#Proxy_Considerations.
	
TO RUN AN EXAMPLE TEST: see how at
	http://www.cafesip.org/projects/sipunit/user_guide.html#mozTocId89601

To debug what's happening during a SipUnit test, turn on the SipUnit trace by adding
    this line of code to your test class setUp() method:
         SipStack.setTraceEnabled(true);
          
    Also you can use the NIST-SIP trace tool.
	It's included in the lib directory. For instructions on using the tool, visit
	http://www.cafesip.org/projects/sipunit/user_guide.html#Debugging
