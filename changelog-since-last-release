	- Fix initialization to allow multiple stacks to run in a single app
TODO: add tests for CANCEL methods with additional headers/body; add test w/proxy
TODO: fix any other test failures
TODO: release doc
TODO: clean up warnings

SipUnit 0.0.6b

- added support for running SipUnit tests from behind a NAT (see SipSession.setPublicAddress(host,port) comments and TestWithStun.java for an example).
- deprecated getLocalViaHeaders(), getLocalContactInfo() in favor of getViaHeaders(), getContactInfo()
- allow multiple sip stacks to be created without specifying IP address.


SipUnit 0.0.5b

- added additional method signatures to take extra parms (body/headers) for message sending
   API NOTE: SipCall.sendReinvite()/respondToReinvite() and some SipSession.sendReply() signatures modified slightly
   Additional signatures added for other methods resulting in request/response sending. 
- picked up final JAIN SIP API and reference implementation changes for version 1.2.
- fixed misc. bugs
- copied xml.xsd to conf dir so offline compile can succeed
   
   
SipUnit 0.0.4b

- upgraded stack to new nist-sip 1.2 release
- created ant script with overridable properties for executing tests grouped by configuration
- added RE-INVITE (w/optional message header manipulation, groundwork for other methods)
- added listen/waitForAck() methods for verifying ACK received.
- fixed minor bugs

TODO NEXT: 
- add CANCEL, MESSAGE, REFER
- incorporate multiple listening points per provider
- ant test script: add more overridable test properties as needed (auth username, password, etc.)
- modify remaining two test classes so they can be invoked from the ant test script like the others
- review TODO'S in the code, address the important ones
- other TODO's from the website TODO list.


SipUnit 0.0.3a

- added asynchronous version of makeCall()
- added more SipTestCase methods: assertAnswered(), assertResponseReceived(x), etc.
- fixed bugs - [ 1231719 ] SipRequest.isXXX() is bugus
             - incorrect Request URI in outbound REGISTER
             - incorrect routing of ACK when proxy sets LR param in record route header
             - added authentication challenge handling to SipCall.disconnect(), needed for callee BYE sending through proxy
             - corrected 'is it for me?' check in SipSession.processRequest()
             - fixed SipSession synchronization problems
- fixed example source dir tree in binary distribution packaging, added more detailed instructions for running examples

- added new feature: client-side SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY handling (Type II, distributed agents) and a
  utility to simulate a presence server for the purpose of testing a Type II client.




NOTES on nist-gov stack 1.1 mods included with this package
   - routing problem: nist-sip-stack needs to set record-route header lr param
   - challenged BYE problem: nist-stack SipDialog CSEQ checking doesn't handle gaps
   - fix for the above didn't handle SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY sequencing

TODO next release
   - PUBLISH
   - put client-side loop control check in authentication challenge handling
